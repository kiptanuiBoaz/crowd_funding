            <p>Just in case you have transacted on social
            media and communication platforms, Ibet you will relate to this.</p>
            
            <p> Let’s
            take Facebook for instance. There are two traders, A and B, on the 
            Facebook Marketplace which by the way has an average user analytics of 
            2.7 billion people every month .i.e. close to 35% of the total world 
            Population. </p>
       
            <p>A buyer virtually approaches botht raders. Due to increased
            fraudulent cases, the buyer insists that they will pay for whatever item
            they are ordering on delivery.</p>

        
            <p>One of the two traders agrees to the deal
            while the other insists that some carriage fee should be made inform of a
            deposit just in case. </p>
            
            <p>Long story short, trader B keeps losing 97% of his
            weekly orders due to his deposit policy while trader A ends up incurring
            losses interms of transportation cost every time a trader doesn’t show up
            at the rendezvous point. Which is 50% of all times. </p>
  
            
            <p>From this we can see
            that there’s only one thing missing. TRUST. That’s where The Franchise
            comes in. </p>

            <p>
            Losing 50% in time or 97% of the total orders is not a problem. The
            Opportunity Cost is. While trader A is on transit to place a delivery that
            ends up failing, he losses 3 genuine buyers to B that come visiting his
            shop only to find it close. </p>
            
            <p>While trader B is busy selling to only 3
            customers falling from A, he is even busier and very serious losing 29 out
            of 30 of his total weekly orders.</p>
            
            <p> What if there was a way to repair this trust
            and actually utilize the current market potential from 57% to 61% to as
            high as 70% - 80%? With our Marketing strategy, Traffic Magnetism,
